This is my daily writing habit, sharing about Ethereum in English. This is inspired in Nathan Barry's experiment: [Writing 1000 words a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPkNt1gFdZ4&t=8707s){:target="_blank"} and Seth Godin's quest to write every day. Don't expect daily posting, but a constant effort on sharing something online.

## Hola, I'm juandav.eth!

I'm interested in Ethereum and will be sharing my writings about it here. Mainly the interaction of Ethereum and education.
