title: What is Ethereum for me
---

This is my attempt to write about Ethereum in simple terms. I will avoid any technical jargon and want to focus on the human side of Ethereum. For me, Ethereum means more than a blockchain. It's fascinating to think how this technology has created a movement of people. 

I feel a strong connection to the community. So what is an Ethereum community? A group of aligned individuals willing to use Ethereum and improve it. Let me explain why I consider myself part of that community. 

First, I use Ethereum as a currency. *Ether* is the money I have most of my savings and investment. Being part of this world is interacting financially with a new financial world. Think of it as a nation that trust and gives value to that form of money. Inside that nation there are states, cities and villages that accept **ETH** (another way to refer to the currency) and are open to trade it for their own token. 

Sharing a currency is way of common identity. After all is a belief that those numbers on the screen are valuable for me and the other people inside that nation. We are part of something bigger than us. We identify with ourselves with our name. There is a particular way of naming inside the Ethereum community. You can see it on Twitter, one of the most used social networks where the Ethereum community communicates. For example, my account is `@juandaveth`, the last three letter are a sign of the family I feel part of.

Nation and family. Those are important ideas in any people's lifes. All are related to belong to a group. I use the same currency then I'm part of a nation (ETH). I've added to my personal identity some sort of lastname, I am `juandav.eth`.

Since that it's an important part of my life and I care about Ethereum, then I work to improve it. The way I contribute to Ethereum is through education. My understanding of education is the act of communicate and explain how the technology works and its effects on people's lifes. 

There is another part of my identity that influences my type of contributions. Being part of the Ethereum nation as a Colombian citizen determines the way I behave inside the community. Moving from the inner circle to a bigger picture, I've contributed in my city, country and region.

My first contribution was starting Ethereum Bogotá back in 2020. We were in the middle of the pandemic, the whole world was forced to be at their homes. I quit my job on April and decided to build something that uses Ethereum. So, with a friend we created a videocall platform. On June 6th we taught [how to interact with a dApp and recibe Ether](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/ethereum-bogota/events/271029586/). That was the beginning of the community in Bogotá.

At the same time Devcon was coming to Colombia, that played an important role in the development of Ethereum in my country. I was first approached by Steven from the Ethereum Foundation he planted the seed to start a technical community, not only in my hometown but to have a national effort. Then I was introduced to other members in Barranquilla, Colombia. The OGs from the Caribe, Devcon was the excuse to connect and the fertile ground the flourishment in four different regions in Colombia.

At the same time in several parts of Latam there was more people entering the Ethereum nation via the *Ether*. Argentina is one of the most prolific lands of builders and users of Ethereum. I see the south of America with a sense of gratefulness and admiration. The force and liveness of the argentinean community led me to be part of [ETH Latam in Bogotá](https://mirror.xyz/ethlatam.eth/BY8Hm--O79aKT4h6TeYqepANqvrYtl6Vo5mHd5Bb8bE). A Monday, October 10th 2022, I was part of the organizing team of this regional gathering one day before Devcon.

In the middle I was able to travel as the Community Supporter for Devcon 6, being part of the amazing team led by Skylar is one of the most important professional and personal experiences I've had. That way of contributing allowed me to meet like-minded people. We didn't share a common citizenship, we value and share the same principles.

Having those similar compasses I've ended up contributing with incredible human beings. A group of people that are connected through a technology, that serves as an excuse to work for a set of principles. We identify in a core level and want Ethereum to be used and improved.

I've complemented my identity, found a sense of belonging and a mission in Ethereum. That's what Ethereum means for me.
